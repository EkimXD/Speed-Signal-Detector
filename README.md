# Speed-Signal-Detector
This is a Speed Signal Detector Project developed for Artificial Inteligent class, the motivation of this project is to provide cars with a speed signal detector on the road and be alert if the established limit is being exceeded.
## Materials
- Computer
- Arduino UNO
- Remote Control Car with a speed sensor
## Tools
- Haar Cascade (for signal recognition)
- Arduino IDE (like a arduino compiler)
- PyCharm (for developed the code)
## Model
We had many speed signals images, we use haar cascade for training the model and we use MNIST database for recognice numbers.
